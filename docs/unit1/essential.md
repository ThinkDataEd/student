##**IDS Unit 1: Essential Concepts**

###**<u>[Lesson 1: Data Trails](lesson1.md)</u>**
Data are a collection of recorded observations. Data are gathered by people and by sensors.
Patterns in data can reveal previously unknown patterns in our world. Data play a large, and
sometimes invisible, role in our lives.

###**<u>[Lesson 2: Stick Figures](lesson2.md)</u>**
Data consist of records of particular characteristics of people or objects. Data can be organized in
many different ways, and some ways make it easier than others for achieving particular purposes.

###**<u>[Lesson 3: Data Structures](lesson3.md)</u>**
Variables record values that vary. By organizing data into rectangular format, we can easily see
the characteristics of observations by reading across a row, or we can see the variability in a
variable by reading down the column. Computers can easily process data when it is in
rectangular format.

###**<u>[Lesson 4: The Data Cycle](lesson4.md)</u>**
A statistical investigation consists of cycling through the four stages of the Data Cycle; statistical
questions are questions that address variability and are productive in that they motivate data
collection, analysis, and interpretation. The Data Collection phase might consist of collecting data
through Participatory Sensing or some other means, or it might consist of examining previously
collected data to determine the quality of the data for answering the statistical questions. Data
Analysis is almost always done on the computer and consists of creating relevant graphics and
numerical summaries of the data. Data Interpretation is involved with using the analysis to answer
the statistical questions.

###**<u>[Lesson 5: So Many Questions](lesson5.md)</u>**
Statistical questions address variability.

###**<u>[Lesson 6: What Do I Eat? [The Data Cycle: Consider Data]](lesson6.md)</u>**
After raising statistical questions, we examine and record data to see if the questions are
appropriate.

###**<u>[Lesson 7: Setting the Stage [The Data Cycle: Collect Data]](lesson7.md)</u>**
In Participatory Sensing, we humans behave as if we are robot sensors, collecting data whenever
a "trigger" event occurs. Our ability to learn about the patterns in our life through these data
depends on our being reliable data collectors.

###**<u>[Lesson 8: Tangible Plots [The Data Cycle: Analyze Data]](lesson8.md)</u>**
Distributions organize data for us by telling us (a) which values of a variable were observed, and
(b) how many times the values were observed (their frequency).

###**<u>[Lesson 9: What Is Typical?](lesson9.md)</u>**
The “center” of a distribution is a deliberately vague term, but it is one way to answer the
subjective question "what is a typical value?" The center could be the perceived balancing point
or the value that approximately cuts the area of the distribution in half.

###**<u>[Lesson 10: Making Histograms](lesson10.md)</u>**
Histograms can be created through the use of an algorithm. The distributions displayed in a
histogram can be classified using the technical terms for the shapes of distributions. Learning to
describe routine tasks through an algorithm is an important component of computational thinking.

###**<u>[Lesson 11: What Shape Are You In?](lesson11.md)</u>**
Identifying the shape of a histogram is part of the **interpret** step of the Data Cycle.

###**<u>[Lesson 12: Exploring Food Habits](lesson12.md)</u>**
Once Participatory Sensing data has been collected, the Dashboard and PlotApp perform the
analysis step of the Data Cycle, though humans need to tell the computer which plots to examine.

###**<u>[Lesson 13: RStudio Basics](lesson13.md)</u>**
The computer has a syntax, and it can only understand if you speak its language.

###**<u>[Lesson 14: Variables, Variables, Variables](lesson14.md)</u>**
To examine whether two (or more) variables are related, we can plot their distributions on the
same graph.

###**<u>[Lesson 15: Americans’ Time on Task](lesson15.md)</u>**
Learning to examine other analyses is an important part of statistical thinking.

###**<u>[Lesson 16: Categorical Associations](lesson16.md)</u>**
A two-way table is a summary of the association/relationship between two categorical variables.
Joint relative frequencies answer questions of the form "what proportion of the people/objects had
*this* value on the first variable and *this* value on the second?"

###**<u>[Lesson 17: Interpreting Two-Way Tables](lesson17.md)</u>**
Marginal (relative) frequencies tell us about the distribution of a single variable. Conditional
relative frequencies tell us about the distribution of one variable when "subsetting" the other.

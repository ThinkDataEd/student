##***<u>Lesson 16: Categorical Associations</u>***

###**Objective:**
Students will learn to construct, interpret, and calculate the joint relative frequencies of two-way frequency
tables.

###**Vocabulary:**
two-way frequency table, joint relative frequency

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: "
    A two-way table is a summary of the association/relationship between two
    categorical variables. Joint relative frequencies answer questions of the form "what proportion of the
    people/objects had *this* value on the first variable and *this* value on the second."

###**Lesson:**
1. Launch the lesson by displaying the following scenario:

    Rosa has a theory that cat owners are also musical. To find out, she decided to
    collect data that would help her understand the relationship between cat
    ownership and instrument playing among the students in her art class. She
    conducted a survey and found that out of the 35 students in her art class, 16
    owned a cat and out of those that owned a cat, 7 played an instrument. She also
    discovered that 9 owned a cat, but did not play an instrument. There were also 9
    students who neither owned a cat nor played an instrument.

2. Inform students that Rosa asked two questions that provided the data for her two-way frequency
table. What could those two questions be?

    <span style="color:grey">***Possible Answer: ***</span>

    <span style="color:grey">***Question 1—Do you play an instrument?***</span>

    <span style="color:grey">***Question 2—Do you own a cat?***</span>

3. What variables did Rosa collect? What were the values of those variables?

4. In pairs, write out on paper what the original data must have looked like.

    <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Variable 1: Owns Cat. Variable 2: Plays Instrument***</span>

    <span style="color:grey">***Owns Cat &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plays Instrument***</span>

    <span style="color:grey">***Yes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(There are 7 of these)***</span>

    <span style="color:grey">***Yes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9 of these)***</span>

    <span style="color:grey">***No&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10 of these)***</span>

    <span style="color:grey">***No&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9 of these)***</span>

5. Inform students that today they will be looking at associations in categorical variables.

    **<u>Note:</u>** If necessary, review the difference between questions for categorical and numerical
    variables.

6. Explain that their task is to summarize Rosa’s findings in one table that shows totals. Remind
students to use their knowledge of data structures from [Lesson 2](lesson2.md), especially organizing in rows
and columns.

7. Allow time for teams to wrestle with how to organize their data in one table. As teams work, walk
around monitoring their data tables.

8. Select a few data tables to display and share with the entire class.

9. Explain the *Anonymous Author* strategy to students (see [Instructional Strategies](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/4_IDS_Teacher Resources_v_5.0/TR_Instructional Strategies.pdf) in [Teacher
Resources](../download/resources.md)).

10. Display the data tables and ask students to engage in the *Anonymous Author* strategy. You may
want to start the discussion by asking about the total number of students Rosa surveyed.

11. Make sure the last data table you display correctly shows a **two-way frequency table**. A two-way
frequency table displays the data that pertains to two categories from one group. One category is
represented in rows and the other is represented in columns. In this exercise, the group is a class
of art students.

    **Cat Ownership and Instruments**

    |  | **Plays an instrument** | **Does not play instrument** | **Total** |
    | ------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
    | **Owns a cat** | 7 | 9 | 16 |
    | **No cats** | 10 | 9 | 19 |
    | **Total** | 17 | 18 | 35 |

12. Based on the Cat Ownership and Instruments table, ask student teams to generate questions that
can be asked and answered by the data.

13. In a *Whip Around*, ask student teams to share one of their questions.

14. Explain that a two-way frequency table can show relative frequencies. A **relative frequency** is
how often something occurs in relation to the total number of occurrences, and is expressed as a
proportion or percentage of a total. For example, what is the relative frequency of those who own
a cat and play an instrument? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: 7/35 or 0.2 or 20%.***</span>

    **<u>Note:</u>** Review how to write a proportion and how to express a proportion as a percent.

15. Ask students to calculate the relative frequencies for the entire table. They may check their
calculations with a partner.


    **Cat Ownership and Instruments**

    **Relative Frequencies**
    
    |  | **Plays an instrument** | **Does not play instrument** | **Total** |
    | ------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
    | **Owns a cat** | 7/35=0.20 | 9/35 ≈ 0.26 | 16/35 ≈ 0.46 |
    | **No cats** | 10/35 ≈ 0.29 | 9/35 ≈ 0.26 | 19/35 ≈ 0.54 |
    | **Total** | 17/35 ≈ 0.49 | 18/35 ≈ 0.51 | 35/35 = 1.00 |

16. In teams, students will generate 2 questions about 2 categorical variables. Allow teams 3-5
minutes to generate their questions. Students should not choose two random categorical
variables. Rather, they should choose two categorical variables that they predict might be
associated.

17. The team will create a two-way table that corresponds to their categorical variables.

###**Class Scribes:**

One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics
of the day were.

###<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Homework**</p>
Rosa posed this statistical question:

***What proportion of students did not play an instrument and did not own a cat?***

Use what you know about two-way tables to answer her question.

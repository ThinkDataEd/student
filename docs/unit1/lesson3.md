##***<u>Lesson 3: Data Structures</u>***

###**Objective:**
Students will learn that data can be represented in rectangular format.

###**Materials:**
1. DS journals (must be available during every lesson)

2. *Stick Figures* cutouts (see [lesson 2](lesson2.md))

###**Vocabulary:**
variables, numerical variables, categorical variables, rows, columns, rectangular or spreadsheet format,
variability

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: "
    Variables record values that vary. By organizing data into rectangular format, we
    can easily see the characteristics of observations by reading across a row, or we can see the variability in
    a variable by reading down the column. Computers can easily process data when it is rectangular format.

###**Lesson:**

1. Remind students that they briefly learned what **variables** are during the previous lesson. Have
students create their own definitions of the term “variables” and share their responses with their
teams. Select a few students in the class to share out their definitions and discuss what could be
modified (if anything) to create a more complete definition.

2. Using the *Stick Figure* information from [Lesson 2](lesson2.md), allow the class to come up with a set of
variable names that describe the different categories of information. Note that it is best when
variable names are short (one to three words). The variable names for the *Stick Figures* data
could possibly be:

    100. Name

    100. Height

    100. GPA

    100. Shoe or Shoe Type

    100. Sport

    100. Friends or Number of Friends

3. Next, have a class discussion about how the values from “Shoe” are different than the values
from “Height.”

    100. The values from “Shoe” are either “sneakers” or “sandals”.

        **Note:** Other terms for these shoes are acceptable – e.g., tennis shoes, flip flops, closed-toe,
        open-toe, etc.

    100. The values from “Height” are 72, 68, 61, 66, 65, 61, 67, and 64.

4. Students should notice that the “Shoe” variable consists of categories or groupings, and the
“Height” variable consists of numbers. Therefore, we can classify variables into two types:
**categorical variables** and **numerical variables**. Typically, categorical variables represent
values that have words, while numerical variables represent values that have numbers.

    **Note:** Categorical variables can sometimes be coded as numbers (e.g., “Gender” could have
    values 0 and 1, where 0=Male and 1=Female).

5. As a class, determine which variables from the *Stick Figures* data are numerical, and which
variables are categorical. The students should create two lists in their DS journals similar to the
ones below (the correct classifications are in grey):

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**<u>Numerical</u>** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**<u>Categorical</u>**

    &nbsp;1. <span style="color:grey">***Height***</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <span style="color:grey">***Name***</span>

    &nbsp;2. <span style="color:grey">***GPA***</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <span style="color:grey">***Shoe***</span>

    &nbsp;3. <span style="color:grey">***Friends***</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <span style="color:grey">***Sport***</span>

6. Explain that although we can understand many different representations of data (as evidenced by
the posters from [Lesson 2](lesson2.md)), computers are not as capable. Instead, we need to organize data in a
structured way so that a computer can read and interpret them.

7. One way to organize the data is to create a **data table** that consists of **rows** and **columns**. We
can define this type of organization as **rectangular format**, or **spreadsheet format**.

8. Display a generic table on the board (see example below) and explain that the columns are the
vertical portions of the table, while the rows are the horizontal portions. Another way to think of it
is that columns go from top to bottom, and rows go from left to right.

9. Ask students:

    100. What should each row represent? <span style="color:grey">***Each row should represent one observation, or
    one stick figure person in this case.***</span>

    100. What should each column represent? <span style="color:grey">***Each column should represent one variable. As
    you go down a column, all the values represent the same characteristic (e.g.,
    Height).***</span>

10. On the board, draw the following table and have the students copy it into their DS journals (be
sure to use variable names agreed upon by the class):

    <img src="../../img/10310.png" />

11. In teams, students should complete the data table using all 8 of the *Stick Figures* cards. Each row
of the table should represent one person on a card.

12. Engage the class in a discussion with the following questions:

    100. Do any of the people in the data have the same value for a given variable? In other words,
    does a value appear more than once in a column? Give two examples. <span style="color:grey">***Answers will
    vary. One example could be that Dakota, Kamryn, Emerson, and London all wear
    sneakers. Another example could be that Charlie and Jessie are both 61 inches tall.***</span>
 
    100. Do any of the people in the data have different values for a given variable? <span style="color:grey">***Absolutely.
    There are many instances of this in the data table.***</span>

13. Discuss the term **variability**. As in question (b) above, the values for each variable vary
depending on which person we are observing. This shows that the data has variability, and the
first step in any investigation is to notice variability. We can see the relationship between the
terms **variable** and **variability**. The word “variable” indicates that values vary.

###**Class Scribes:**
One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics
of the day were.

##***<u>Lesson 6: What Do I Eat?* [The Data Cycle: Consider Data]</u>**

###**Objective:**
Students will collect data using paper and pencil to understand the challenges of organizing, storing, and
sharing data. They will learn that there must be an agreement about the variables that need to be
recorded in order to attain consistency.

###**Materials:**
1. Video: Jamie Oliver’s *Food Revolution* found at:<br>
    [https://youtu.be/I0vYwqkoktM](https://youtu.be/I0vYwqkoktM "https://youtu.be/I0vYwqkoktM")

    </iframe><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I0vYwqkoktM">https://www.youtube.com/embed/I0vYwqkoktM</a></div>

    **Note:** If the video is unavailable, search for “"Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution What's In a
    Sundae". The video should be 5-6 minutes in length.

2. Nutrition Facts labels or pictures (collected previously by students)

    **Note:** If needed, use *Nutrition Facts Cutouts* handout ([LMR_1.7_Nutrition Facts Cutouts](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.7_Nutrition Facts Cutouts.pdf))

3. *Food Habits Data Collection* handout ([LMR_1.8_Food Habits Data Collection](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.8_Food Habits Data Collection.pdf))

###**Vocabulary:**
data set(s)

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts:"
    After raising statistical questions, we examine and record data to see if the
    questions are appropriate.

###**Lesson:**
1. Inform students that today’s lesson will focus on the Data Collection component of the Data Cycle.

2. To motivate this, the students will watch a short video of an episode of Jamie Oliver’s show titled
*Food Revolution* found at: [https://youtu.be/I0vYwqkoktM](https://youtu.be/I0vYwqkoktM "https://youtu.be/I0vYwqkoktM"). This particular video was recorded at a
Los Angeles high school.

    100. As the students watch the video, they should use their DS journals to write down their
    comments and/or reactions to what they see and hear and be ready to share out.

    100. After sharing out some of their responses, have the students respond to the following
    question in their DS journals: **Why should I care about what I eat?**

    100. Student teams will share their reactions and responses by engaging in a Silent
    Discussion (see [Instructional Strategies](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/4_IDS_Teacher Resources_v_5.0/TR_Instructional Strategies.pdf) in [Teacher Resources](../download/resources.md)).

3. Have students recall the *Stick Figures* activity from [Lesson 2](lesson2.md). During that activity, they collected
data about other people. But today, they are going to be collecting data about themselves and the
foods they eat.

4. Students should have Nutrition Facts labels available from food/snacks they consumed at home
between the previous lesson and today. Note: If some students forgot to bring any, then you can
pass out some of the *Nutrition Facts Cutouts* ([LMR_1.7](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.7_Nutrition Facts Cutouts.pdf)) for them to use instead.

5. For 3-5 minutes, allow students to collect any data they can from the label and record it in their
DS journals. This should be done individually.

6. Once they have collected their facts, ask students to compare and contrast their data with their
team members. They need to respond to:

    100. How are their **data sets** similar?

    100. How are their **data sets** different?

7. Gather the students as a whole group and ask them to share out the similarities and differences
they discussed. Be sure to draw responses that show that while some facts collected were the
same, there were others that were collected by some students and not by others. Also point to
differences in the variables collected and the data structure used.

    100. Ask students to engage in the following individual Quickwrite (see [Instructional Strategies](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/4_IDS_Teacher Resources_v_5.0/TR_Instructional Strategies.pdf)
    in [Teacher Resources](../download/resources.md)): How can the data you just gathered be quickly displayed and
    easily read? 

    100. Distribute the *Food Habits Data Collection* handout ([LMR_1.8](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.8_Food Habits Data Collection.pdf)). Ask students to record 8
    observations. They can use their own 2 labels for the first observations, and then use
    some of their team members’ labels to complete the table.

8. Once they are finished, in pairs, ask students to give a one-word identifier to each variable. For
example: “What’s the name of your snack?” = Name

9. Share the one-word variable identifiers with the class by conducting a quick team Whip Around
(see [Instructional Strategies](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/4_IDS_Teacher Resources_v_5.0/TR_Instructional Strategies.pdf) in [Teacher Resources](../download/resources.md)).

10. For homework, students will begin to formulate statistical questions based on their *Food Habits*
data.

11. Inform students that they are permitted to bring mobile devices to the next class.

###**Class Scribes:**
One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics
of the day were.

###<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Homework**</p>
Ask students to examine the data in their *Food Habits Data Collection* handout ([LMR_1.8](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.8_Food Habits Data Collection.pdf)) and to
generate two simple and two complex statistical questions that they think can be answered by the data
they collected. A simple statistical question involves one variable, whereas a complex statistical question
involves two or more variables.

Students may bring their mobile devices to the next class for data collection purposes.

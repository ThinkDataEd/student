!!! note "Essential Concepts: "
    Distributions organize data for us by telling us (a) which values of a variable were
    observed, and (b) how many times the values were observed (their frequency).


###**Lesson:**

1. <u>**Food Habits Campaign Data Collection Monitoring:**</u>

    100. Display the IDS Campaign Monitoring Tool, found at [https://tools.idsucla.org](https://tools.idsucla.org "https://tools.idsucla.org")<br>
    Click on **Campaign Monitor** and sign in.

    100. Inform students that you will be monitoring their data collection. This is a good
    opportunity for teachers to remind students that if their data are not shared, they cannot
    be used in analysis.

        200. See *User List* and sort by *Total*. Ask: Who has collected the most data so far?

        200. Click on the pie chart. Ask: How many active users are there? How many inactive
            users are there?

        200. See *Total Responses*. How many responses have been submitted?

        200. Using TPS, ask students to think about what can they do to increase their data
            collection.

2. Inform students that today they will be learning how to visualize their data.

3. Show the *Value of Data Visualization* video at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xekEXM0Vonc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xekEXM0Vonc "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xekEXM0Vonc"),
which describes the importance of graphical representations of data. As they watch the video,
students should respond to the following in their DS journals:

    100. What is data visualization?

    100. List one example of how visualization can be used to increase data comprehension.

4. Have a whole class discussion regarding the video’s last statement: “Your message is only as
good as your ability to share it.” Ask students:

    100. What does this statement mean?

    100. What makes a good message in terms of data and visualizations?

5. Have students take out their nutrition facts labels or pictures, and also their *Food Habits Data
Collection* handout (from [lesson 6](lesson6.md)).

6. On poster paper, make the first quadrant of a coordinate plane. Leave the labels for the **x-axis**
and **y-axis** blank for now (see step 10).

7. Distribute 3 pieces of tape to each student. Make sure they fold each piece of tape to make two
sticky sides. Have each student tape one sticky side to the back of each label and ask them to
have the labels ready to tape onto the poster paper.

8. As a class, ask students to select 2 numerical variables and 1 categorical variable from the *Food
Habits Data Collection* handout whose data they would like to see in a **visualization**, which is a
picture of the data. For example, students may vote to see a visualization of the following
numerical variables: calories per serving, total fat per serving; categorical variable: salty_sweet

9. Once students select the variables, inform them that they will be creating a plot with the nutrition
facts labels for each of the variables they selected.

10. Create a bargraph of the categorical variable chosen by the students. Begin by showing students
how to clearly label the x-axis with the categories. For instance, if salty_sweet is the variable, ask
students to identify the categories for that variable. Then mark the y-axis with the label **frequency**,
which simply means the number of times an outcome occurs. Do not put tick-marks on the y-axis.
The frequency will be measured by the number of labels plotted.

11. Have students come up and place their nutrition fact label above the category that describes their
snack. Have students stack their nutrition label so that is easy to calculate the frequency. Once all
the labels have been placed, create bars with the appropriate height (frequency) for each
category. Make sure to leave spaces between the bars, and that bars are the same width.

12. Ask students to respond to the following questions in their DS journals:

    100. How many **data points** does this distribution have? Why?

    100. What information is this visualization telling us about <u>[insert categorical variable
    name]</u> in the snacks we consume?

13. Use another piece of poster paper to create a distribution for the first numerical variable chosen
by the students.

14. Create a dotplot of the first numerical variable chosen by the students. Begin by showing students
how to clearly label the x-axis. For instance, if calories per serving is the variable, ask students for
the range of values for calories per serving and determine the **minimum** and **maximum** values
for the data set. Clearly label the x-axis with adequate intervals and the variable’s name. Then
mark the y-axis with the label **frequency**, which simply means the number of times a value
occurs. Do not put tick-marks on the y-axis. The frequency will be measured by the number of
labels plotted.

15. For each value in the data set, put a nutrition facts label above that value on the x-axis. When a
value occurs more than once, stack the nutrition facts labels. For example, if there are three
nutrition facts labels with 120 calories per serving in the data set, there will be three nutrition facts
labels above the 120 mark on the x-axis.

16. Once all the labels have been placed, ask students to observe the **distribution** of the data in the
dotplot. Ask students to respond to the following questions in their DS journals:

    100. What are the minimum and the maximum values of the data set? <span style="color:grey">***Answers will vary by
    class.***</span>

    100. **The range** is the largest value minus the smallest value. It is one way of measuring the
    variability of a variable. What is the range, and why do you think this measures the
    variability? <span style="color:grey">***Answers will vary by class. The range measures variability because if
    the values of the variable are really different, the range will be a big number
    (because the max and min will be far apart); but if there is little variability, the
    range will be small. For example, if all of the values were the same, we would have
    no variability and the range would be 0 because the max and min would be the
    same number.***</span>

    100. How many **data points** does this distribution have? Why? <span style="color:grey">***Answers will vary by class.***</span>

    100. What is the amount of <u>[insert variable name]</u> that appears most often in a snack? Why?
    <span style="color:grey">***Answers will vary by class.***</span>

    100. What do you think the phrase *distribution* of the *data set* means? <span style="color:grey">***It shows us how
    values are distributed. We learn where there are many values, where there are only
    a few values, and where there are no values at all.***</span>

    100. What information is this distribution telling us about the <u>[insert variable name]</u> in the
    snacks we consume? <span style="color:grey">***Answers will vary. We see how the value of [variable name]
    varies. For example, we can see whether all foods have the same number of
    calories, or if they differ.***</span>

    100. A distribution tells us two things: the values of the variable and the frequency of the
    values. "Frequency" is just another way of saying "the count." Why is this dotplot a
    picture of the distribution of [variable name]? <span style="color:grey">***Because the location of the labels on the
    x-axis tells us the values we saw, and the number of labels at that value tells us the
    frequency for that value.***</span>

17. Review the students’ responses in a class discussion. Ask students to put a check mark next to
the answers that were validated, and to revise the answers that need to be corrected.

18. Use another piece of poster paper to create a distribution for the second numerical variable
chosen by the students. Repeat steps 14-16 with this variable.

19. On the first visualization for the numerical variable, show students how to convert the nutrition
facts labels into something more readable. Draw another horizontal like on the plot above the
nutrition facts labels. Explain that we can represent each label with an item such as a dot sticker
or a sticky note.

20. Then, start with the minimum x-value on the plot and place the new sticker above the second
horizontal axis. Do this for each nutrition facts label in the plot. Once all values have been
represented, ask the students how this new plot IS or IS NOT better than the original. Explain that
we can call this type of plot a **dotplot** since we’re using dots to represent each observation.

21. Distribute the *Tangible Plot* handout ([LMR_1.9](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.9_Tangible Plot.pdf)). Each student should pick one of the 2 numerical
variables plotted on the poster paper. Then, they should complete part 1 of the *Tangible Plot*
handout before leaving class. They will complete part 2 of the handout for homework.

22. Ask students to think about the statistical questions they came up with. Can the visualizations
they created in class help answer their statistical question? If yes, answer the question; if not,
what visualization would be appropriate?

###**Class Scribes:**
One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics
of the day were.

###<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Homework**</p>
Students will complete part 2 of the *Tangible Plot* handout ([LMR_1.9](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_1.9_Tangible Plot.pdf)) and bring it to the next class for
assessment.

Students should continue to collect nutritional facts data using the *Food Habits* Participatory Sensing
campaign on their smart devices or via web browser.

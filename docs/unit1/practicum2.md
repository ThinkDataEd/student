##***<u>Practicum: Teen Depression</u>***

###**Objective:**
Using the CDC data set, students will apply their learning of statistical concepts to determine possible
factors that might be associated with depression in teens. They will create graphical representations to
analyze and interpret the data. Students will present their findings to their teams the following day.

###**Materials:**

1. *Teen Depression Practicum* ([LMR_U1_Practicum_Depression](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_U1_Practicum_Depression.pdf))

2. *Depression Fact Sheet* ([LMR_U1_Practicum_Depression_Fact Sheet](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 1_v_5.0/LMR_U1_Practicum_Depression_Fact Sheet.pdf))

###**Background:**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collect data about teenagers on a variety of topics.
One of these topics is depression. According to the fact sheet published by the National Institute for
Mental Health, depression is a real problem among teens.

###**Instructions:**
With a partner, you will read the depression fact sheet and then use the CDC data to address the
Research Topic.

###**Research Topic:**
What factors are associated with depression in teens?

###**Task:**
1. Create a poster that addresses the Research Topic.

2. Generate a statistical question that might address the Research Topic.

3. Use RStudio to create at least one statistical graphic. The graphic MUST be included on the
poster.

4. You and your partner will present your findings with appropriate evidence from the data.

###**Awards:**
Your teacher will select the top posters in the following categories:

* Best Statistical Question

* Most Interesting Statistical Graphic

###**Scoring Guide:**
4-point response:

* The poster identifies possible factors that are in the data set that might be associated with
depression in teens.

* A graphical representation that shows an association was created.

* An answer and a justification for the answer to the statistical question are presented.

* A justification includes mention of statistics concepts learned thus far. For example, “The
variables are…” ; **<u>AND</u>** it includes acknowledgment of variability. For example, “There are
between <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> and <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>.”

3-point response:

* The poster identifies possible factors in the data set that might be associated with depression in
teens.

* A graphical representation that shows an association was created.

* An answer and a justification for the answer to the statistical question are presented.

* A justification includes mention of statistics concepts learned thus far. For example, “The
variables are…” ; **<u>OR</u>** it includes acknowledgment of variability. For example, “There are between
<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> and <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>.”

2-point response:

* The poster identifies possible factors that might be associated with depression in teens.

* A graphical representation that shows an association was created.

* An answer and a justification for the answer to the statistical question are presented.

1-point response:

* The poster identifies possible factors that might be associated with depression in teens.

* An answer to the statistical question is presented but a justification is missing.

* A histogram, bar chart, scatterplot, or other graphical representation was correctly created.

0-point response:

* The poster does not identify possible factors that might be associated with depression in teens

* A histogram, a dot plot or other graphical representation was incorrectly created **<u>OR</u>** is missing.

* No answer **<u>AND/OR</u>** no justification for the answer to the statistical question is presented.

##***<u>Lesson 12: Don’t Take My Stress Away!</u>***

###**Objective:**
Students will read the Huffington Post article titled *Don’t Take My Stress Away* to spark their interest
about how they spend their time, and will continue to read reports critically to look for claims that may or
may not be based on data.

###**Materials:**
1. Article: *Huffington Post’s Don’t Take My Stress Away* found at:<br>
[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jack-cahn/dont-take-my-stress-away_b_2090203.html](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jack-cahn/dont-take-my-stress-away_b_2090203.html "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jack-cahn/dont-take-my-stress-away_b_2090203.html")

2. Data collection devices

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: " 
    Generating statistical questions is the first step in a Participatory Sensing campaign.
    Research and observations help create applicable campaign questions.

###**Lesson:**
1. Become familiar with the *Stress/Chill Campaign Guidelines* (shown at the end of this lesson),
particularly the questions, to help guide students during the campaign (see [Campaign Guidelines](campaign1.md)
in [Teacher Resources](../download/resources.md)).

2. Ask students the following questions and conduct a brief share out of their responses.

    100. Do you know anyone who seems to be always stressed or anyone who seems to be
    always chilled? <span style="color:grey">***Answers will vary by class.***</span>

    100. What are some observations you have made that make that person extremely stressed
    or chilled? <span style="color:grey">***Answers will vary by class.***</span>

3. Inform students that they will be learning about some high school students who view stress as a
part of life in the Huffington Post article titled *Don’t Take My Stress Away*.

4. Provide students the link to the article and allow time for them to read it:
[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jack-cahn/dont-take-my-stress-away_b_2090203.html](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jack-cahn/dont-take-my-stress-away_b_2090203.html "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jack-cahn/dont-take-my-stress-away_b_2090203.html")

5. As they read the article, students should note whether they agree or disagree with the authors
and should write down their comments and/or reactions to the article in their DS journals.

6. Ask student pairs to share if they agree or disagree with the authors of the article and why.
Conduct a *Share Out* of student responses.

7. Inform students that for this unit, we will be investigating how stressed or chilled they are at
certain times of the day.

8. Students will collect data using the *Stress/Chill* Participatory Sensing campaign. They will add the
*Stress/Chill* campaign to their list of available campaigns either through the UCLA [IDS UCLA App](../download/app.md)
or via web browser at [https://tools.idsucla.org](https://tools.idsucla.org "https://tools.idsucla.org")

9. Ask students to complete their first survey.

10. After students have completed their first survey, use a random number generator to generate two
random times a day for the next 6 days (RStudio example given below). It is recommended that
you create 6 sets of random numbers so that students are polled at different times each day.

    Example for RStudio (assuming students are awake between the hours of 7:00 am and
    11:00 pm):

    **> sample(7:23, size = 2, replace = FALSE)**

    **<u>Note:</u>** If a time falls within the school day, it is up to the discretion of the teacher to use this time
    or not.

11. Based on the times generated, ask students to set reminders on the [IDS UCLA App](../download/app.md) for the next 6
days. Students without a mobile device may set reminders using a method available to them.

12. Focus students’ attention on the *Stress/Chill* survey questions (you may display the questions on
the Campaign Guidelines document). Ask students to generate three statistical questions that
could be answered using the *Stress/Chill* data.

13. Then, ask them to write down in their DS journals some predictions about what they think they will
see after they collect some data.

###**Class Scribes:**
One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics
of the day were.

For the next 6 days, students will collect data for the *Stress/Chill* campaign either through the UCLA [IDS

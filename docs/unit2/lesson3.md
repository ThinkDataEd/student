##***<u>Lesson 3: Median in the Middle</u>***

###**Objective:**
Students will learn that the median is another way to measure the center, or typical-ness, of a distribution,
and will understand how medians compare and contrast with the mean.

###**Materials:**
1. Sticky notes (one per student)

    **Advanced preparation required** (see step 6 below)

2. Poster paper

3. Graphics from *Medians – Dotplots or Histograms*? ([LMR_2.4_Medians – Dotplots or Histograms](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_5.0/LMR_2.4_Medians - Dotplots or Histograms.pdf))

4. *Where is the Middle*? handout ([LMR_2.5_Where is the Middle](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_5.0/LMR_2.5_Where is the Middle.pdf))

5. Exported, printed, and reproduced class’s *Personality Color* survey data

###**Vocabulary:**
median

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: "
    Another measure of center is the median, which can also be used to represent the
    typical value of a distribution. The median is preferred for skewed distributions or when there are outliers
    because it better matches what we think of as 'typical.'

###**Lesson:**
1. Remind students that, during the previous lesson, they learned about the mean as the balancing
point of a distribution and as a measure of center. In statistics, there are a few values that can be
considered as measures of center – the mean is one, and another is the **median**. The median is
the middle value in a group of ordered observations.

2. As a simple example, write or display the following group of numbers on the board:

    8, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4, 9, 5, 5

3. Since there are 9 numbers in the list above, we should be use the 5<sup>th</sup> number as the median
because it is directly in the middle and there are 4 numbers above it, and 4 numbers below it.

4. However, students should realize that they cannot simply pick the middle number of the list as it
is currently written (this would give a median value of 7). Instead, they must first arrange the
numbers in numerical order (from lowest to highest).

    2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

5. Now they can identify that the true median value of this list of numbers is 5.

6. Next, randomly distribute one sticky note to each student.

    **Advanced preparation required:** There should be one card for every student in the class. All of
    the cards, except one, need to have the value 0 written on them. One card should have the value
    1,000,000 written on it.

7. Place poster paper on the board and have the students create a dot plot by placing their sticky
notes at the corresponding values on the axis. Then, ask and record answers to the following
questions:

    100. What is the typical value of these data? <span style="color:grey">***0 – all sticky notes but one have a value of 0.***</span>
    
    100. Using the formula we learned in class, calculate the mean, or average, value of this
    distribution. <span style="color:grey">***Answer will vary by class/class size. Example: for a class with 28
    students enrolled, there would be 27 values of 0 and 1 value of 1,000,000.
    Therefore, the mean value would be (0\*27 + 1,000,000)/28 ≈ 35,714.3. ***</span>
    
    100. Does the mean you calculated match your understanding of “typical?” Why is the mean
    not capturing our notion of “typical?” <span style="color:grey">***The 1,000,000 value is heavily skewing the
    calculation of the mean. It is pulling the mean to a higher value than what we
    consider to be typical for these data.***</span>

8. Since we introduced the idea of the median as a measure of center at the beginning of class,
have the students find the median value of the data on their sticky notes. If time permits, have
them place the sticky notes in a line across the board in order (from least to greatest) and have
them find the middle number. The median value will be 0.

9. Ask students why there is such a large difference between the mean and median values even
though they are both measures of center? Is there a specific reason why the mean is larger than
the median for this particular set of data? <span style="color:grey">***In this case, there was an outlier value that skewed
the distribution and forced the balancing point to move to the right.***</span>

10. Display the first 2 plots in the *Medians – Dotplots or Histograms*? file ([LMR_2.4](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_5.0/LMR_2.4_Medians - Dotplots or Histograms.pdf)). They are
labeled as plots for discussion for the *beginning* of class. Both the dotplot and histogram depict
the number of candies eaten by a group of 17 high school students.

11. For the first 2 plots, ask students:

    100. Which plot makes it easier to find the median number of candies eaten – the dot plot or
    the histogram? Why? <span style="color:grey">***The dot plot is easier because we can simply find the middle
    dot and record the value. It is harder on the histogram, because we would have to
    add up amount in each bar to find the middle person.***</span>

    100. What is the median value? <span style="color:grey">***The median number of candies eaten is 1 candy.***</span>

12. Inform the students that they will practice finding medians of distributions using the *Where is the
Middle?* handout ([LMR_2.5](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_5.0/LMR_2.5_Where is the Middle.pdf)). They will be determining medians when distributions have different
shapes (e.g., symmetric, left-skewed, right-skewed).

13. Distribute the *Where is the Middle?* handout ([LMR_2.5](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_5.0/LMR_2.5_Where is the Middle.pdf)). Students should complete the handout
individually first, then compare answers with their team members. Once each team has agreed
upon their answers, discuss the handout as a class.

14. Ask the following questions to elicit a team discussion about the relationship between means and
medians:

    100. What did you notice about the relationship between the mean and median values for the
    symmetric distributions? <span style="color:grey">***The mean and median values in the symmetric distributions - 
    plots (a) and (d) - are fairly similar. For plot (a), the mean and median are exactly
    equal. For plot (d), the mean is actually larger than the median, but not by much
    (2.29 > 2).***</span>

    100. What did you notice about the relationship between the mean and median values for the
    left-skewed distributions? <span style="color:grey">***The mean value was smaller than the median value in both
    of the left-skewed distributions - plots (c) and (f). Both plots had the same values
    for the mean (2.53) and the median (3.00) - clearly, the mean is much smaller than
    the median (2.53 &lt; 3).***</span>

    100. What did you notice about the relationship between the mean and median values for the
    right-skewed distributions? <span style="color:grey">***The mean value was larger than the median value in both
    of the right-skewed distributions - plots (b) and (e). For plot (b), the mean was only
    slightly higher than the median (1.18 > 1). For plot (e), the mean was a decent
    amount higher than the median (0.47 > 0).***</span>

15. Steer the discussion towards the relationship between the shape of a distribution and its
corresponding mean and median values.

    100. Is there a pattern that emerges between the mean and median values for differently
    shaped distributions? <span style="color:grey">***Yes! It seems that symmetric distributions will produce similar
    mean and median values, left-skewed distributions will produce smaller means and
    higher medians, and right-skewed distributions will produce higher means and
    smaller medians.***</span>

    100. For each of the plots in the *Where is the Middle?* handout ([LMR_2.5](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_5.0/LMR_2.5_Where is the Middle.pdf)), which value better
    matches your idea of “typical” for that specific distribution? <span style="color:grey">***For plot (a), both the mean
    and median agree and appear to be the balancing point of the distribution – both
    match what we think is typical. For plot (b), the median seems to be more typical,
    but the values are very close. For plot (c), the median appears to be a more typical
    value. For plot (d), both the mean and median appear to be capturing our idea of
    typical. For plot (e), the median is a better match to typical. For plot (f), the median
    is also a better match.***</span>

16. Steer the discussion so that students recognize that the better measures of center for skewed
distributions are typically medians, and the better measures for center for symmetric distributions
are typically means.

17. Display the last 2 plots in the *Medians – Dotplots or Histograms* file ([LMR_2.4](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 2_v_5.0/LMR_2.4_Medians - Dotplots or Histograms.pdf)). They are labeled
as plots for discussion for the end of class. Both the dot plot and histogram depict the number of
candies eaten by a group of 330 high school students.

18. For the last 2 plots, ask students:
    
    100. Which plot makes it easier to find the median number of candies eaten – the dot plot or
    the histogram? Why? <span style="color:grey">***The histogram is easier because we can estimate based on the
    distribution’s shape. There are too many dots in the dot plot to find the exact
    middle person.***</span>
    
    100. What is the median value? <span style="color:grey">***The median number of candies eaten is 7 candies.***</span>
    
###**Class Scribes:**
One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the
day were.

###<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Homework**</p>
Students should calculate the median values for each of their personality color scores. They should
compare the median values to the mean values (calculated in [Lesson 2](lesson2.md)) and make a decision about
the possible shape of the distribution if we were to create a dot plot of the scores.

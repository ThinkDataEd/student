##***<u>Practicum: Win Win Win</u>***

###**Objective:**
Students will create and combine simulations to assess probabilities.

The California lottery has a game called the *Daily 3*.

• It consists of 3 numbers between 0 - 9 that are drawn daily.

• The numbers are drawn with *replacement*.

• Winners are usually awarded a couple hundred dollars.

• To win the maximum amount of money, players must correctly choose the numbers that are
drawn, in order.

Based on what you learned in [*Lab 2C*](lab2c.md) and [*Lab 2D*](lab2d.md) (*Which Song Plays Next* and *Queue it Up!*) and using
the rules of the *Daily 3*, you need to:

1. Write down the code to correctly simulate the *Daily 3* once.

2. Use your code to simulate the *Daily 3* 500 times.

3. Compute the estimated probability of getting the first 2 numbers of the *Daily 3* correct.

4. Should the estimated probability of correctly guessing the last 2 numbers of the *Daily 3* be less
than, the same as, or more than guessing the first 2 numbers? Why?

5. In teams of 4:

    a. Each team member chooses 3 numbers for the *Daily 3*.

    b. Each team member simulates the *Daily 3* game 500 times.

    c. Within your group, combine the team simulation estimates to estimate the probability of
    winning the *Daily 3*.
    
6. Write and submit a one-page report. Your report should include the code.

##***<u>Lesson 16: Does It Have a Trigger?</u>***

###**Objective:**
Students will learn to identify and categorize survey questions versus sensor questions, and will practice
writing sensor questions.

###**Materials:**
1. Poster paper (one per student team)

2. Sticky notes

3. *Sensor or Survey?* handout ([LMR_3.14_Sensor or Survey](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 3_v_5.0/LMR_3.14_Sensor or Survey.pdf))

###**Vocabulary:**
Participatory Sensing

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: "
    A key feature that distinguishes the way sensors collect data from more traditional
    approaches is that sensors collect data when a 'trigger' event occurs. In Participatory Sensing, this event
    is something we humans agree upon beforehand. Every time that trigger happens, we collect data.

###**Lesson:**
1. Refer back to the list of sensors the class created during the previous lesson. Distribute a piece of
poster paper to each student team, and have them create the following table:
    
    <img src="../../img/31601.png" />

2. Assign each student team 3 sensors from the class’s list.

3. Then, each team should complete the table using their knowledge of triggers discussed during
the previous lesson. Remind students that when a trigger occurs, a sensor reacts to it and sends
a signal to a data collector.

4. Conduct a *Gallery Walk* of the posters. Each team will get to write one reaction or question about
what they see on each poster.

5. After the Gallery Walk, ask each team to return to their posters. If the posters include questions,
have teams take turns responding to the questions.

6. *Quickwrite*: In their DS Journals, ask student to respond to the following questions. They will have
two minutes to write as much as they can:

    a. When you learned about survey questions, what were the two categories of questions
    you learned about? <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Open-ended and Closed-ended are the categories.***</span>

    b. What are some examples of these types of questions? <span style="color:grey">***Open-ended: write a paragraph,
    comments, essays, write a sentence, single answer. Closed-ended: multiple or
    single choice, yes/no, scales (e.g. 1-5), choose from a list, check a box.***</span>

7. In teams, ask students to share their responses using the *Give One/Get One* strategy. You may
use a timer to keep track of time.

8. Remind students that one of the most important things they learned about sensors is that there is
a trigger that reminds either a device or a person to answer a question or to collect data.

9. For this class, students have already had experience with using sensors as a data collection tool
– all the **Participatory Sensing** campaigns.

10. Explain that survey questions are asked in Participatory Sensing campaigns. There is no
difference in the type of questions that are asked when collecting data via surveys and when
collecting data via PS campaigns.

11. When deciding whether to use a survey or a PS campaign for data collection, we have to look at
the research question of interest. Some questions are better answered with survey data, while
others with PS campaigns. Research questions that include variation across time or across
locations are good candidates for PS. Some questions might be answered by both.

    **<u>For example:</u>**

    Consider the research question: How does my sense of safety and security change as I go about
    my daily routine? This question would best be answered via a PS campaign because students
    could collect data in real time about their sense of security. A possible trigger could be "whenever
    you change locations" or "once at the start of every hour" or perhaps whenever a random alarm
    goes off.

    Consider the research question: What proportion of high school students are superstitious? This
    question could be done with a survey based on a random sample from the population of all high
    school students.

12. Distribute the *Sensor or Survey?* ([LMR_3.14](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 3_v_5.0/LMR_3.14_Sensor or Survey.pdf)) handout. In teams, students will determine whether
a sensor or survey is better for a given research scenario.

13. Once the teams have completed the handout, assign each team one research scenario from the
*Sensor or Survey* activity.

14. Conduct a *Whip Around* and have each team share their responses with the class. Allow students
time to revise any incorrect responses.

15. Summarize the lesson by highlighting that PS campaigns and surveys use similar questions.
However, depending on the research topic of interest, the decision to use one or the other relies
on whether or not a trigger is involved.

###**Class Scribes:**
One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the
day were.

###<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Homework**</p>
Suppose we wish to know more about whether people behave superstitiously. Write two research
scenarios, using the following questions as a guide:

a. How would you collect data to address this using PS? Include the trigger event you would
use, and the data you would like to collect when the trigger happens.

b. How would you collect data to collect this using a survey based on a random sample of
people in California?

c. Describe the differences between these two approaches. What can you learn in one
approach that you can't in the other?

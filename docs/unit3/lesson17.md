##***<u>Lesson 17: Creating Our Own Participatory Sensing Campaign</u>***

###**Objective:** 
Students will be guided through the creation of a new Participatory Sensing campaign and
survey on a topic of interest chosen by the class.

###**Materials:**
1. *Food Habits Campaign Questions* handout ([LMR_3.15_Food Habits Qs](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 3_v_5.0/LMR_3.15_Food Habits Qs.pdf))

2. *Campaign Creation Brainstorm* handout ([LMR_3.16_Campaign Creation](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 3_v_5.0/LMR_3.16_Campaign Creation.pdf))

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: "
    Creating a Participatory Sensing Campaign requires that survey questions must be
    completed whenever they are “triggered”. Research questions provide an overall direction in Participatory
    Sensing Campaign.

###**Lesson:**
1. Review homework questions by asking a couple of students to share their responses. The rest of
students will engage in *Agree/Disagree* as the questions are shared.

2. Display the following definition of Participatory Sensing that some computer scientists have
agreed to and ask students to read and record this definition in their DS journals:

    At its heart, Participatory Sensing is data collection and interpretation.
    Participatory Sensing emphasizes the involvement of citizens and community
    groups in the process of sensing and documenting where they live, work, and
    play. It can range from private personal observations to the combination of data
    from hundreds, or even thousands, of individuals that reveals patterns across an
    entire city. Most important, Participatory Sensing begins and ends with people,
    both as individuals and members of communities. The type of information
    collected, how it is organized, and how it is ultimately used, may be determined
    in a traditional manner by a centrally organized body, or in a deliberative manner
    by the collection of participants themselves. The latter case, in particular,
    emphasizes the novelty of Participatory Sensing as an approach and
    underscores the importance of using widely available and familiar technology.

    patterns that shape our world."]

3. Activate prior knowledge: Based on this definition, ask students to recall the Participatory Sensing
campaigns in which they have engaged thus far. <span style="color:grey">***Answer: Food Habits, Time Use, Stress/Chill.***</span>

    **<u>Note:</u>** *Personality Color* and *Time Perception* were surveys, not Participatory Sensing campaigns
    because they were only completed once. Their data was not collected over time.

4. Inform students that they will be creating a new, whole class Participatory Sensing campaign, but
before they do that, they will analyze the *Food Habits Campaign Questions* handout ([LMR_3.15](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 3_v_5.0/LMR_3.15_Food Habits Qs.pdf)).
<div align="right"><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https://curriculum.idsucla.org/IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0_preview/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 3_v_5.0/LMR_3.15_Food Habits Qs.pdf&embedded=true" style=" width:420px;height:400px;" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>[LMR_3.15](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 3_v_5.0/LMR_3.15_Food Habits Qs.pdf)</div>

5. In teams, allow students two minutes to discuss the following as they analyze the Food Habits
Campaign questions:

    100. How many questions does the campaign have and what do they notice about the
    questions? <span style="color:grey">***Answers will vary. Students may notice that they are survey type of
    questions and may identify the type of questions such as open-ended, single-choice,
    etc.***</span>

    100. When do these questions need to be answered? <span style="color:grey">***Each time they eat a snack.***</span>

    100. Who collects the data for this campaign? <span style="color:grey">***The participants collect their own data.***</span>

6. Ask a few teams to share their insights about the discussion. In the share-out, guide students to
see that the questions are in fact survey questions. Although survey questions are answered
once, when we collect data every time a 'trigger' event occurs, then we are engaging in
Participatory Sensing.

7. Ensure that team roles have defined duties to keep teams on task for the rest of this lesson.
Creating this class campaign will follow a process in which consensus (or a majority rule) will be
reached in each step of the campaign development within each team. Inform students that they
will be creating a Participatory Sensing campaign on a topic of their interest using [LMR_3.16](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 3_v_5.0/LMR_3.16_Campaign Creation.pdf).

8. <u>Round 1:</u> First, teams will discuss their hobbies, areas of interest, or places or processes they
want to know more about. Prompt students to think about whether they want to learn about
"where they live, work, or play." All students within the group must agree on a hobby or area of
interest to be their topic of their interest to create a campaign for. <span style="color:grey">***An example of a hobby is
practicing cello. An area of interest might be 'the environment.' A place of interest might
be "our school" or "my church" or "Disneyland."***</span>

9. Once teams have decided on a topic for their group, have teams share out their topic of interest.
As a class, decide on one topic that will be used for creating a new Campaign.

10. <u>Round 2:</u> Now have teams consider what research questions you might ask about this topic of
interest. <span style="color:grey">***An example of a research question for practicing cello is “How can I improve my
playing?” or "How can I practice more effectively?"***</span>

11. Once teams have decided on a research question for their group, have teams share out their
research question. As a class, decide on one research question that will be used for creating a
new Campaign.

12. <u>Round 3:</u> Next, they will examine what kind of data needs to be collected in order to answer this
research question. They should discuss possible triggers that will determine when data should be
collected. Allow teams to engage in a discussion about when is the best time to trigger the data
collection/completion of the survey. For example: every day at 8am; whenever they practice the
cello; whenever they see an advertisement; etc. They should record it in their DS Journals. <span style="color:grey">***An
example of a trigger for practicing cello is whenever you play the cello. In this case, it
could be any time of day or even multiple times of the day.***</span>

13. Once teams have decided on a trigger for their group, have teams share out their possible trigger.
As a class, decide on one trigger that will be used for creating a new Campaign.

###**Class Scribes:**
One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the
day were.

###<p style="background: black; color: white; text-align: center;">**Homework**</p>
Using the class topic, research question, trigger event, and discussion of the data they plan to collect.
Classify our class campaign under the appropriate category with your justification:

 (A) Individual; (B) Groups of people; (C) Community

**<u>Note to teacher:</u>** To determine which category a campaign should be placed under, consider the
question "Who or what will we learn about?" If the answer is "only one person", then place in the
Individual category. The cello campaign is an example of this. If we might learn about lots of people, put it
in the Groups of People category. The Food Habits, Stress/Chill, and Time Use campaigns fit into this
category (they learn about the students in the class). A campaign that wanted to know where all of the
churches in the neighborhood were located, or wanted to try to keep people from littering, or wasting
water, these should go into the "community" category.

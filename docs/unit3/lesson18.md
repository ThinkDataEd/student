##***<u>Lesson 18: Evaluating Our Own Participatory Sensing Campaign</u>***

###**Objective:** 
Students will create statistical questions and evaluate their Participatory Sensing Campaign.

###**Materials:**
1. *Campaign Creation* handout ([LMR_3.16_Campaign Creation](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 3_v_5.0/LMR_3.16_Campaign Creation.pdf)) from [previous lesson](lesson17.md)
2. Class Campaign Information from [Lesson 16](lesson16.md)

###**Essential Concepts:**

!!! note "Essential Concepts: "
    Statistical questions guide a Participatory Sensing Campaign so that we can learn
    about a community or ourselves. These Campaigns should be evaluated before implementing to make
    sure they are reasonable and ethically sound.

###**Lesson:**
1. Review homework by giving students about five minutes to share their classifications in their
teams. They will decide as a team which classification is the most fitting.

2. Once the five minutes have passed, have a class discussion of classifications and their
justifications. Explain to the class that the campaign must be carried out by the whole class so if it
has been classified in the Individual category, it must be revised. Also discuss whether the
campaign is feasible. (For example, is the trigger so rare that no one will collect data? Are the
questions too intrusive?).

3. Inform students that one of the promises of PS is it's potential for helping people bring about
social and civic change. Ask teams to consider the following questions and report back:

    100. Does our campaign try to do this?

    100. Could it be changed or modified to do this?

    **<u>Note:</u>** Feasible campaigns fall under the groups of people or community categories. If a
    campaign in the individual category, it should be modified to fall under the other categories before
    moving to round 4.

4. Display the campaign information students generated (and selected as a class) the previous day
or revised today: Topic, Research question, Trigger, and Type of Data needed.

5. Now they will continue the rounds using the Campaign Creation handout [LMR 3.16](../IDS_Curriculum_v_5.0/2_IDS_LMRs_v_5.0/IDS_LMR_Unit 3_v_5.0/LMR_3.16_Campaign Creation.pdf) from the
previous lesson.

6. <u>Round 4:</u> Now that the class has decided on a trigger and the type of data needed, they will
create survey questions to ask when the trigger is set. The questions should consider all of the
possible data they might collect at this trigger event. It's ok if the list is long; the goal is to be
creative and think of lots of different ideas.

    <span style="color:grey">***Examples of survey questions for practicing cello are:***</span>

    <span style="color:grey">***“How long did you practice?”***</span>

    <span style="color:grey">***“What did you play?”***</span>

    <span style="color:grey">***“How would you rate your practice session: 1 to 5?”***</span>

    <span style="color:grey">***“Any thoughts or comments about your practice?”***</span>

7. Once teams have created 4 survey questions for their group, have teams share out their survey
questions. As a class, decide on no more than 10 survey questions that will be used for creating a
new Campaign.

    100. Then, evaluate each survey question. For each question they should consider:

        200. What type of data will this question collect? (Numerical, discrete numerical, text,
        categories, photos, location).

        200. How does this question help address the research question?

        200. Does the question need to be reworded? (Is it clear what is being asked for? Do
        they know how to answer it?)

    100. If the survey questions need to be rewritten, assign teams to rewrite survey questions.
    Then, as a class, decide on the changes.

    100. Once finalized, write the survey question that goes along with that data variable, being
    cognizant of question bias.

8. <u>Round 5:</u> In teams, now generate two to three statistical questions that they might answer with
these data. Make sure your statistical questions are interesting and relevant to the class topic of
interest. They may keep a record in their DS Journals. Remind students that they will also have
data about the date, time, and place of data collection.

    <span style="color:grey">***Examples of statistical questions that can be answered for practicing cello are:***</span>

    <span style="color:grey">***“How frequently do I practice?”***</span>

    <span style="color:grey">***“When I practice more frequently, do I rate my sessions higher?”***</span>

    <span style="color:grey">***“Are higher-rated sessions associated with time of day?”***</span>

9. Once teams have generated their statistical questions, have them share out with the class.
Confirm that the questions are statistical and that they can be answered with the data the
students propose to collect. As a class, decide on no more than 3 statistical questions to guide
your campaign.

10. Now that they have all the pieces of the campaign, evaluate whether it’s a reasonable and
ethically sound campaign. Engage the class in a whole group discussion on the following
questions:

    100. Are answers to your survey questions likely to vary when the trigger occurs? (If not, you'll
    get bored entering the same data again and again)

    100. Can the entire class carry out the campaign?

    100. Do triggers occur so rarely that you'll have very little data? Do they occur so often that
    you'll get frustrated entering too much data?

    100. Ethics: Would sharing these data with strangers or friends be embarrassing or undermine
    someone's privacy?

    100. Can you change your trigger or survey questions to improve your evaluation?

    100. Will you be able to gather enough relevant data from your survey questions to be able to
    answer your statistical questions?

11. Students have collaboratively created their first Participatory Sensing campaign. Inform them that
you will be demonstrating one tool used to create the campaigns that they see on their smart
devices or the computer. Students should take notes in their DS journals, as they will be using the
tool later.

###**Class Scribes:**
One team of students will give a brief talk to discuss what they think the 3 most important topics of the
day were.
